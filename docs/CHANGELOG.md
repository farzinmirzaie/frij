# Changelog

Newest first. One short entry per change.

## 2026-06-07

- Trimmed `platformio.ini`: collapsed the header comment, dropped the redundant
  `LVGL_USE_V8=0` define, and tightened comments.
- Made `CLAUDE.md` the single project-context file (dropped the `AGENTS.md` symlink).
- Trimmed `support/sdl2_build_extra.py` (drop unused import + dead code, add comment)
  and the obsolete copy-instructions header in `include/lv_conf.h`.
- Expanded README: how it works, controls, and how to add an app.
- Merged `lv_conf_v9.h` into `include/lv_conf.h` (single LVGL config file).
- Apple-Silicon-only: removed Intel/Linux/Windows build notes and the unused
  `-m32` handling in `support/sdl2_build_extra.py`.
- Tightened README and docs; removed conversational/session-specific phrasing.
- Made the project target-agnostic: dropped board-specific branding; apps are
  pure LVGL, only `src/utility/` is board-specific. Board specs moved to
  `docs/HARDWARE.md`. Device env renamed to `device`.
- Added `docs/SKILLS.md` (relevant Claude tooling) and a rule to forbid `sa-*`
  skills in this repo.
- Added the launcher + isolated mini-app architecture: neutral contract
  (`src/app.h`), launcher with tile grid and open/back navigation, an app
  registry, and example apps (`todo`, `counter`) wired in `src/apps/apps.cpp`.
- Trimmed the upstream emulator fork to a minimal base: two PlatformIO envs
  (`emulator_Dial`, `device`), LVGL v9 only, removed EEZ Studio, Tab5, unused
  boards, scaffold READMEs, and image assets.
- Added `CLAUDE.md` and `docs/` for project context.
